## Woof Woof: We Get Your Dogs Covered
Term: Spring 2020

+ Team # 1

+ Shiny Link : https://loving-dogs.shinyapps.io/Group1_Project2/

+ **Project summary**: 

In a city of cramped living quarters, fifth-floor walk-ups and limited access to outdoor space, you may think pets would be a tough sell for New York City residents. Yet roughly 425,000 dogs live in New York City – more dogs than there are people in Oakland, CA.

To develop this project, we referenced the data on NYC Open Data, as well as other open data sources such as Google, Github and Kaggle, to uncover the most popular dog breeds and names in NYC neighborhoods, and the best neighborhoods in New York City for dogs and their faithful owners. Moreover, we included the statistical analysis of the most dog bites occurence in NYC neighborhoods for those people who want to live in the neighborhoods with fewer dogs. Our project goal is to help you get extensive dog-related information around NYC's neighborhoods.

+ **User guide**: 
    + Click the "Dog parks & hospitals" tab, you can find the nearest dog parks to walk your dogs, with the walking distance and estimated transportation time available. Don't panic when your dog get sick, use our map to find the nearest dog hospitals.
    + Click the "Dog Density Map" tab, in the 'Dog license map', you can find the dog license information distributed by area. In 'Dog Density Map', you can find the most dog friendly neighborhoods as well as the specific number of dogs in those areas. Click the 'Dog Bite Map', you can view information about the dog bites accidents by neighborhoods and check by time.
    + Click the "Summary Statistics" tab, you can view the statistical results about NYC dogs' names and breeds. There are settings available for you to customize the plots. Scroll down and try them out!
    + Other related news and articles can be found in the remaining tabs. Enjoy the journey with us.
